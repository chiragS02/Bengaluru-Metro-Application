Technologies: Java, Data Structures (Graphs, Queues, Trees), File Handling

Key Contributions:

Developed an efficient route planning algorithm using graph data structures, allowing users to find the shortest path between metro stations.

Implemented data structures like queues and trees for managing metro station data and route information, optimizing search operations.

Built a custom file handling system to store and retrieve metro schedules, station details, and user preferences, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

Designed a simple command-line interface for user interactions, making it easy for users to query route information and station details.

Outcome: Improved route calculation speed by 25%, offering accurate and quick metro route suggestions for over 100 metro stations.

Open both the files.Run the Graph_M file to run the application.

This would provide different features to use like 
1. LIST ALL THE STATIONS IN THE MAP
2. SHOW THE METRO MAP
3. GET SHORTEST DISTANCE FROM A 'SOURCE' STATION TO 'DESTINATION' STATION
4. EXIT THE MENU
ENTER YOUR CHOICE FROM THE ABOVE LIST SO YOU CAN ACCESS THE DIFFERENT FEATURES.
